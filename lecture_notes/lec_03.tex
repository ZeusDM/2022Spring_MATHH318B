\section{Interaction with Boundness}

\begin{prop}{}{}
  There exists a sequence of functions \(f_n \colon A \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), all of them bounded on \(A\), and \(f_n \to f\) pointwise on \(A\) for a unbounded function \(f\) on \(A\).
\end{prop}

\begin{dem}{}{}
  Consider \(f_n \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) defined by \[
    f_n(x) = 
	\begin{cases}
	  x & |x| < n \\
	  0 & \text{otherwise,}
	\end{cases}
  \]
  which converges pointwise to \(f(x) = x\) on \(\mathbb{R}\).
\end{dem}

\begin{prop}{}{}
  If \(f_n \colon A \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is bounded for each \(n\), and if \(f_n \to f\) uniformly on \(A\), then \(f\) is bounded on \(A\).
\end{prop}

\begin{dem}{}{}
  Plug \(\epsilon \mapsto 1\) on the definition of uniformly convergence. Then, there exists \(N\) such that \[
    |f_n(x) - f(x)| < 1
  \] 
  for all \(n \geq N\) and all \(x \in A\).

  Since \(f_N\) is bounded, there exists \(M\) such that \(|f_N(x)| < M\) for all \(x \in A\).
  Finally, by triangular inequality, we conclude that \[
    |f(x)| < M + 1,
  \] 
  for all \(x \in A\); therefore, \(f\) is bounded.
\end{dem}
